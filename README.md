 ### the concept
 ---
 the main concept of this board is only using very accessible and cheap components and tools.
 I don't have a 3d printer nor i orderd a costume pcb.
 I ordered the chepest components and tools i could find.
 the reason is i very much liked the idea of a split ergonomic keyboard , but as you can guess ordering a kit a or a pre built one war very expesive for me.
 I didn't find anyone who built one in this way , so i'm making this documentation hopping it could help or isnpire other people.
